                        <h3>A New Philosophy (Purpose > Motivation)</h3>
                        <p>As the first week of university draws to a close, I can't help but feel a bit excited and overwhelmed about the new skills I will acquire in the year to come. Throughout the break, I have had time to re-evaluate my approach to learning and in turn tackle my academics this year from a fresh perspective. My approach to university last year was very mark-centric and tended to fall prey to favoritism, not the healthiest learning mindset, and hence everything felt like a blur with a few concepts that seem to have stuck around and the others lost in the void of my brain. Very noticeably I enjoyed the game dev/coding side of the course and tended to give SUPREME effort into that end, and as a result have not made the most of my available resources. My approach this year will try and even out the playing field and allow me to give equal attention to each of my modules. This will have to come with great discipline and hence I have adopted the "Purpose > Motivation" philosophy.</p>
                        <p>Motivation is great, we love that feeling we have of wanting to get started on something especially at the beginning of the year: </p>

                        <p>
                            With regards to the URL scheme, I would like to make my portfolio website a secure site. In order to make it a secure website, I will have to follow a protocol that will allow me to obtain and install an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). To be very honest... on a surface-level it seems do-able but taking a second glance at it makes it look like more and more of a hassle. In order to get an SSL you have to register your website by generating a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) on your server. I'm not too sure if I can make my school laptop a functioning server to host my website... but it doesn't seem like a good idea. But that is only one of the many issues and decisions I will have to make with regards to obtaining an SSL (at the moment I am severely underqualified and ignorant). So, for the time being I will just have to stick with keeping it as an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) instead of HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). edit: I just realized GitHub does all the admin for you! THANK YOU GITHUB!

                        <h3>Alignment</h3>
                        <p>
                            The alignment of a website can outline the purpose of its design. This sense of direction can better help a website carry out the task that it was meant to do, whether it's selling a product, displaying work or made simply for browsing. All the choices that a designer makes are made with this "alignment" in mind, and they can either assist or obstruct the purpose of the website.
                            On a more philosophical note, we all have our own "alignment". This alignment is better described as our <i>ideal self</i>, the person we want to become, someone you've been working towards. Similar to the realms of web design, we each make decisions that aid our journey of manifesting this <i>ideal self</i>. I will use a Cherokee fable as metaphor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Within each of us lives 2 wolves in constant battle.<br>
                            One, kind and just.<br>
                            The other, cruel and malevolent.<br> 
                            The wolf that wins, is the wolf you choose to feed.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each decision you make can either assist or obstruct the journey of becoming your <i>ideal self</i>. So, choose carefully!
                        </p>
                        <h3>My Web Alignment</h3>
                        <p>
                            The goal for this website is for future employers, or people of interest, to scout my portfolio and get a grasp of who I am, what my skills are, and past projects I've worked on. Users should be able to browse through the contents of this website and gain insight into the level of work I am able to produce. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My target audience are employers (within the programing or gaming industry), that want more insight or tangible proof that I am a suitable candidate for the open position. The attraction points for such an audience would be past projects that display my current skillset, and I'm assuming that they would also like to play/use the things I've developed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hence, I will display the information of my website in a manner that highlights the work that I produce and makes it easily accessible to see my latest projects. The user experience will also leave a lasting impression on the level of work I am able to produce. In order to align this experience with the purpose of the website, I will ensure that users are greeted with a professional yet personal setting. I will follow the UI and UX trends that companies such as Riot Games, Unity, and Unreal Engine seem to fall under. This will, hopefully, make a bold statement to the user and clearly state my intentions.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Semantic Markup</h3>
                        <p>
                            After learning about semantic markup this week, I decided to implement this newfound standard into my website. <br>
                            These changes include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                changing all div-elements into article and section-elements
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                adding alt-attributes to all my images
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Reordering my h1-h6 elements to form a user-friendly hierarchy.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Adding a nav-element for navigational links 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            With the addition of these features, more people will be able engage with my website without difficulty or exclusion. 
                        </p>
