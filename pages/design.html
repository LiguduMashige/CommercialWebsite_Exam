                            <h3>Introduction to Data Visualization in Data Journalism</h3>
                            <p>
                                Data journalism plays an important role in visualizing a story for consumers with the use of data visualization that has become extremely popular and prevalent within web developers and UI, UX designers. These digital tools have been widely recognized among some of the world's leading news outlets such as The New York Times, The Guardian, Al-Jazeera and the Washington Post with interactive graphics to express their journalism posts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Data visualization in data journalism (specifically political) serves as powerful storytelling techniques that transform complex datasets into an accessible source of information that is engaging for the audience and emotionally gripping. This essay will critically analyze the use of data visualization techniques in the data journalism piece titled “Know Their Names: Palestinians Killed in Israeli Attacks on Gaza”, which was published by the news television network Al-Jazeera, on the 1st of November, 2023. While examining the use of interactive data visualization, this essay will also discuss how principles of data visualization have been effectively applied in this project to convey its message, creating an engaging visualization for its audience.

                            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                            <p>
                                Al-Jazeera, is a news television network that is known for its groundbreaking reporting of human rights issues. They make use of emotionally gripping data charts to emphasize their reports. This data journalism piece aims to not only commemorate the Palestinians lives that were killed but to also make users understand and feel the pain by humanizing their datasets. This project has many features such an interactive visualization that allows the audience to engage and explore with the stories of the deceased and survivors.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This journalism piece is one that is very sad with many detailed accounts and visualizations of individuals and families to ensure that the victims will be remembered and will not be seen as just numbers but people who had lives, families, identities and most importantly, souls. Lastly, the journalism piece aims to shed light on the destructive nature of war, the human cost of conflict and the scale of damage by presenting this data in a form that allows users to not be far removed from the victims like the rest of the world has. This also emphasizes the scale of the tragedy while preserving the dignity of the victims. Diagrams and charts have always been the main data visualization techniques in news data journalism that have often been supported by visual and textual narrative. This specific journalism piece is more immersive and this done effectively by the following:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                1. The heading for the opening visualization “Know Their Names” is in bold white font but the names in the background are in small grey font which is emphasizing two things: the magnitude of the lives lost and how their lives have been seen as insignificant to the Israeli government as we cannot fully see their names .
                                2. The second visualization shows us many families in the background alongside a dotted filled chart that animates and fills up each circle. The numbers of the deaths and the dates keep escalating to highlight the ongoing man-slaughter. This is also highlighted by the human chart of bodies that have time stamps of the deaths and specific gruesome deaths that are filled in red.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These visualizations are seamlessly integrated into the stories as a way of enhancing the users understanding of the story and making users attached to the story. Bostock et al (2011) discusses how researchers have developed a variety of toolkits for facilitating visualization design. The data joins with visual elements, as certain elements of data must be represented visually with specific elements that get the best immersive and storytelling technique (Bostock et al, 2011)

                            <h3>Data Visualization Techniques</h3>
                            <p>
                                The project employs several data visualization techniques, including interactive maps, timeline charts, and individual profiles. Examining the interactive map, it serves as an important element where the users can see the distribution and destruction of casualties across Gaza. This map has markers overlaid that are used as a representation of each victim. This gives the users a visual sense of the widespread impact of the attacks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is also very effective in its narration as the use of a map in data visualization anchors information in a specific geographical context and makes the data more relatable and tangible, especially to people who are not from that geographical region. This is further enhanced by the timeline charts that offer a temporal dimension. For users, this allows us to piece together the series of events and follow the destruction in a sequence. “Together, these visualizations create a comprehensive picture of the situation, emphasizing both the scale and the chronology of the tragedy” (Al-Jazeera, 2023).
                            </p>

                            <h3>Interactivity and User Engagement</h3>
                            <p>
                                The function of clicking on the markers and being able to view and read the information and stories of the victims creates a powerful connection between the viewer and the reader and it further highlights this more than just an interactive experience but we are now immersed in the full scale of the lives of the people who have been suffering. Interactivity and immersion is a great tool used to humanize situations but in this case, it is enhanced and makes the users feel empathetic. It makes the user want to spend more time engaging with the content of the page and discover more about the victims rather than just brushing over it like they are insignificant. Manipulating data to make it interactive and immersive creates a meaningful exploration of information for the users. It takes complex data sets and makes it more manageable to read and understand. (Henninger, 2013). Lastly, the transitions and animation in this article plays a big role in keeping the viewer engaged as they are seamless and intuitive. Henninger (2013), discusses how colour and information design are important to data visualization and draws the eye to what is important whilst a plethora of colour causes confusion. The colours used here are appropriate as they are all monotone, dark and convey the gravity of the subject matter. This design choice shows seriousness of the situation and respects the sensitive nature of the content.

                                <h3>UI/UX Design Principles</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The UI/UX design in this data journalism article allows the users to explore the information without feeling overwhelmed. These elements allow the user to understand and educate themselves without feeling bored or overwhelmed. The careful use of color, spacing, and typography contributes to the overall readability and aesthetic appeal of the project. On a personal choice, I would suggest that the project includes more detailed instructions of navigating through the information and animations that show people have been displaced and their emotions. This leads to how data drives a story.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Data-Driven storytelling</h3>
                                <p>
                                    This specific data-driven article isn't about the numbers. It is about accurately representing the stories of the people behind the numbers to ensure that their identities are the first and last thing the users remember. This plays an important role in narration within complex data elements that cannot be simplified or removed as the full devastation of lives must be represented. It leaves a long lasting impact on you emotionally.Since there is no selected code, I will provide a general improvement to the HTML structure and organization. Here

                                <p>
                                    This is the main message that I believe the project has been trying to convey to users. The emotional impact is amplified in this project as the users feel speechless the more they engage with the data visuals. The colours are so muted in their tones and it reflects a sense of hopelessness that these victims go through on a daily occurance.The use of red for markers on the map highlights the severity and urgency of the situation. This is even seen in the visual illustration of a child on a swing which is also a silhouette but the child is fading into doves. These are all emotionally impactful and show us the innocence of childhood that has been deprived from the children of Gaza.

                                    The combination of data with these compelling stories allows users to resonate on an emotional level. These insights can be applied to future data visualization projects, particularly those that seek to convey complex information in a way that is both informative and impactful. Interactivity in this project is on a personal level that makes users actively consume the information and not passively. This is something that can be applied to future generations of data journalists to not only increase the engagements, but to enhance the comprehension of viewers to understand the data in a humanly relatable manner.

                            <p>
                                Creating a website for Inter Milan football club involved designing a unique online experience to make fans feel connected. My goal was to build a minimalistic site that stayed true to Inter Milan's colors and fonts. This analysis reflects on how I approached the project, covering the economic and artistic impacts of web technologies and design techniques. I'll discuss how my UI/UX choices, particularly in visualizing data and adding interactive features, engaged users. I’ll also cover the challenges faced with live API data, which required some last-minute redesigns, and the steps I could take in future projects to address similar issues.

                            <p>
                                For a global football fanbase, a streamlined, minimalist site design was practical and economic. Minimalism in design is popular because it reduces distractions for users, keeps sites simple to load, and improves performance on many devices. For high-traffic websites, reducing the load time can be essential for user retention, as faster, less demanding sites keep users engaged. By relying on lightweight technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for animations, I created a website that is easy to run across different devices and in diverse internet settings.

                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Using Inter Milans established color palette and fonts was essential to make the website feel authentic. Maintaining consistent branding builds a sense of connection and familiarity for fans. Research shows that when websites stick to a brand’s colors and fonts, it boosts trust and loyalty among users. For Inter Milan, the blue-and-black colors and bold font style represent the clubs identity, making fans feel “at home” when they visit the site.
                            </p>

                                Minimalism can have artistic limitations, though. For example, theres a risk that too few design elements might feel plain. However, the minimalistic approach fits the project because it draws attention to Inter Milan’s traditions without overwhelming users with excessive visual elements. This design choice aligns with international trends in sports websites that prioritize user needs over overly complex design, which appeals to a global audience focused on function and usability.

                            <p>
                                The UI/UX decisions I made were aimed at creating a simple, intuitive website that fans would enjoy. By using smooth animations that change text color, I added interactivity without cluttering the layout. This approach was effective for fan sites, as it subtly encourages users to explore without distracting them. The animations provided visual cues that guided users while keeping the experience dynamic and cohesive. Studies show that small interactive elements like these can increase user satisfaction by creating a personalized, responsive feel.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Data visualizations were essential in giving fans quick insights into Inter Milans performance. However, an unexpected API change during development forced me to redesign parts of the visualizations, as the new data format was different. While I adapted as much as possible, the visualizations ended up less detailed than originally planned. I wanted these visualizations to tell a story about the clubs recent achievements and match stats, but the limitations of the new data format made this more challenging.

                            <p>
                                Good data visualization should focus on clarity and simplicity, but the change in API data meant I had to adjust both data structure and visualization design. Moving forward, I realized the importance of thoroughly evaluating data sources before designing visuals around them. I could have simplified visualizations further, making sure they worked well with data thats easy to extract and display, to avoid overcomplicating things.

                            <p>
                                Interactivity was a major focus of my design, as its essential for building a fan connection to the club. Simple animations, like text color changes, added a layer of engagement and responsiveness without pulling attention from the main content. Interactivity, even in subtle forms, can enhance a fans experience by making the site feel active and alive. Research supports that interactive features can significantly boost user satisfaction, especially on fan-centered websites where immersive experiences are highly valued.

                            <p>
                                However, more football-specific interactive features—like hoverable player stats, clickable team formations, or a match highlight reel—could have strengthened the fan engagement even further. These additions would have made the interactivity feel more tailored to football, giving fans a chance to engage with aspects of the sport they love.

                                One of the primary challenges was working with a live API. The data was nested, meaning that some data points were within other data sets, making it complex to extract for visualization. I created JavaScript functions to organize the data into a usable format, but this added complexity and development time. Reflecting on this, I recognize the importance of thoroughly testing and understanding data structures early on in a project. Going forward, I plan to select APIs that better align with my design requirements or create alternate visuals that can easily adjust to changes in data structure. Although live API-based data is dynamic and offers real-time updates, it can be unpredictable. In future projects, Ill take extra time at the beginning to test how data flows into visualizations to catch potential issues early and avoid redesigns.

                                This project aligned with best practices in global web development, particularly around branding, user-focused design, and responsiveness. By following W3C standards, I ensured the website was accessible across different devices, essential for reaching a global fanbase. A minimalist, clean design aligns with international web trends emphasizing ease of use and accessibility—key factors in a competitive digital world where users have high expectations. While I adhered to many best practices, I learned a lot about data handling, especially with live data. Going forward, I plan to choose APIs with more stable data formats and anticipate data changes to avoid reworking visualizations. Improving these skills will help me create more consistent, adaptable user experiences. Adding adaptable elements for handling diverse data sources will be crucial to maintaining a smooth, high-quality experience.
